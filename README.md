#Word Guessing Game

###3rd Homework Assignment with Javascript

I have created a web app game that plays like hangman, but is way cooler. 

My theme is Will Ferrell Movies and Shows. 
(I am hoping to incorporate a API to dynamically pull in Ferrell latest cinematic endeavor-- that would be neat, right?)

Likenesses, images and voice of Ferrell are used purely for educational purpose and I am, of course, very grateful for Mr Ferrell's non-objections to their use for my project. Also, this would be a great place to mention how very thankful I am for all the laughter and joy his comedy has brought to this serious world. (Please don't sue me.üôè)
